# Machine-learning-project

Machine learning project in the form of a Kaggle challenge, made in collaboration with Xuanye Song. The goal was to get the most accurate prediction of electricity consumption of a house based on on a large number of features (categorical and numerical). 

We implemented techniques such as, regression(linear,lasso,ridge), PCA + regression, GAM, Boosting (XGB), Trees, Random Forest, SVM regression and also tried to treat the problem as a time series using smoothings. 

This was done in R. 

Rmd file contains the script and also generated the report. 

You will find a pdf for the report generated presenting the results as well as the presentation we made. 

We managed to reach third position out of 7 teams.
